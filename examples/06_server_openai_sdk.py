"""Example 6 — use the official OpenAI SDK against the server.

The whole point of the server is OpenAI compatibility: point any OpenAI client at
it and existing code works unchanged.

Install the SDK first:

    pip install openai

Start the server in another terminal:

    python app.py

Then run this from the project root:

    python examples/06_server_openai_sdk.py

from openai import OpenAI

# Point base_url at the server. api_key is required by the SDK but ignored here.
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="unused")

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    # model picks WHICH model answers: deepseek-chat (fast) or deepseek-expert
    # (stronger, slower). thinking (DeepThink) and search (web) are independent
    # toggles; they ride in extra_body, since they're outside OpenAI's schema.
